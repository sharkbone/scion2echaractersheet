# Scion2eCharacterSheet
Scion 2nd Edition Character Sheet

I created this web app because I'm a huge tabletop RPG nerd. I'm currently running a long-running game of Scion 2e, and I'm playing in another game. I'm building this sheet to practice web development, and to make something cool for a game I enjoy.

The current version has basic functionality. It does *not* support Skill Specialties, or any notes connected to different elements of the character. I have a big long list of additions that the app needs, which I will work to add in over time. This probject is to help me learn. I'll keep working on it for as long as I feel like it's helping me achieve that goal.

## Using This Sheet

This character sheet will locally store itself in the browser used to view it. Currently, it only supports a single character, but the plan is to eventually store multiple characters in a local database.
